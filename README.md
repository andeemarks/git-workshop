WE HAVE MOVED!!!

This repo was built for an event promoting Girls In Technology.

I believe very strongly in this cause.

GitHub apparently does not.  See [this article](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/) for details.

This repository can now be found at [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/andymarks/git-workshop).
